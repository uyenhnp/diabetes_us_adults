# Statistics about Diagnosed Diabetes among US Adults

### 1. Introduction
The purpose of this project is to visualize the percentage of diagnosed diabetes among US adults aged >= 18 from 2000 to 2018. Additionally, we would like to investigate the correlation between diabetes rate and age/education/race factors. 

### 2. Data Source and Data Pre-processing (Excel)
You can obtain the data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on this [link](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/diabetes/DiabetesAtlas.html#) or please refer to the **raw data** folder to access to the raw data downloaded. 

To prepare for data visualization, we used Excel to combine multiple files and clean the data. The prepared data is stored in the **cleaned_data** folder.

### 3. Data Visualization (Tableau)
